"""
CI keeps its database and its skip check (Phase 5.5 Stage 0, D-148).

For six days in September 2026, CI reported green while 348 of 391 API tests,
the tenant-isolation tests among them, silently skipped for want of a database
(docs/REVIEW-PHASE5.md H7). These tests fail if any Python CI job stops
starting the database, stops connecting as `docflow_app`, or stops failing on
unapproved skips. Removing one is then a deliberate, visible change to this
file too, not a quiet edit to the workflow.
