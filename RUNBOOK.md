# DocFlow — Runbook

Step-by-step procedures for running DocFlow. Written for the founder: every
step says exactly what to click or paste, and what you should see. Phase 6
completes this file (restore drill, parser upgrades, constants); Phase 5.5
starts it with the procedures that were needed first.

---

## 1. Applying a database migration

Migrations are SQL files in `supabase/migrations/`, applied in number order,
never edited after they have been applied (build prompt Section 5). They are
applied by hand in the Supabase SQL Editor, because the app's own database
role deliberately cannot change the schema (DECISIONS.md D-013, D-017).

**Order of events for any pull request that needs a migration:**

1. Take the backup below, **before** anything else.
2. Check the row counts.
3. Apply the migration file to `docflow-staging`.
4. Tell Claude it is applied. **Do not merge the pull request until Claude has
   run the tests against staging and confirmed** (the PR message says so at the
   top).
5. Merge. Keep the backup until you decide to drop it.
6. From Phase 6 on: only after all of this on staging, apply the same file to
   `docflow-prod`, again with its own backup first.

### 1.1 The standard backup (run before the migration)

Replace `NNNN` with the migration's number and list every table the migration
touches (the PR message names them). In the Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
create schema if not exists backup_NNNN;

create table backup_NNNN.<table_one> as table public.<table_one>;
alter table backup_NNNN.<table_one> enable row level security;

create table backup_NNNN.<table_two> as table public.<table_two>;
alter table backup_NNNN.<table_two> enable row level security;
```

**Why RLS on a backup table:** Supabase's security advisor flags any table
without row-level security. Turning it on with no policies means only the
project owner (you, in the SQL Editor) can read it; the app and the public API
cannot. A backup holds customer data and gets exactly the same protection as
the table it copies.

### 1.2 The row-count check

```sql
select 'table_one' as t, (select count(*) from public.table_one) as live,
       (select count(*) from backup_NNNN.table_one) as backup
union all
select 'table_two', (select count(*) from public.table_two),
       (select count(*) from backup_NNNN.table_two);
```

`live` and `backup` must match on every row. If they don't, stop and say so;
don't run the migration.

### 1.3 Dropping a backup

Only when you decide to, never automatically, and never while the change it
protects is still being checked:

```sql
drop schema backup_NNNN cascade;
```

### 1.4 Running the test suites against staging

**Standing rule: one suite at a time.** Run core, worker, API and web against
`docflow-staging` one after another, never at the same time. The suites share
one database. Several tests create and delete their own tenants, and some
check a count across the whole table, so one suite's test data can fail
another suite's test. This happened on 2026-09-26: the API suite's `deal7`
case failed while the worker suite was running (DECISIONS.md D-160).

The rule stays until every test uses data only it can see: rows with a unique
prefix that the test filters on, or a transaction the test rolls back. The
audit of the "count everything" tests is a Phase 5.5 Stage 5 item
(`docs/BUILD-STATUS.md`).

How a run is reported:

- Save each suite's full output to a file. Never cut it with `tail` or
  `head`: the exit code of the pipe replaces pytest's, so a failed run looks
  like it passed, and the failure details are lost.
- Quote pytest's last line as printed. The API suite should read `424 passed,
  3 deselected` with nothing failed or skipped (391 before the Stage 1
  walkthrough fixes added tests; if the count is *lower* than the number
  written here, find out what stopped running before calling the run green).
  The 3 deselected are the `live_api` tests, which only run at checkpoints
  (`apps/api/pyproject.toml`): `pytest -m live_api` — the golden fixture, the
  golden fixture with examples, and the example-contamination check.

### 1.5 The live end-to-end suite (`apps/web/e2e-live`)

The one browser suite with nothing stubbed: a real sign-in, the real API over
HTTP, real Postgres, real RLS (DECISIONS.md D-166). It needs three things
running before it will do anything useful.

1. **The API**, on port 8000:

   ```
   cd apps/api && .venv/Scripts/python -m uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000
   ```

2. **A current production build of the web app.** The suite serves it on port
   3101, and Next compiles `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` into the bundle — so a build made
   against different settings will point the browser at the wrong stack:

   ```
   cd apps/web && npm run build
   ```

3. **Then the suite itself**, which seeds its own throwaway tenant, reviewer
   and orders before the run and deletes them after it:

   ```
   cd apps/web && npm run test:e2e:live
   ```

It counts as one of the suites under the one-at-a-time rule above. The tenant
it creates is named `Acme Test Live E2E <id>`; if a run is interrupted before
its teardown, remove the leftovers with:

```
python scripts/seed_live_e2e.py teardown --out apps/web/e2e-live/.seed.json
```

CI runs the same suite in the `web-live` job against the local Supabase stack,
so it needs no staging credentials there.

### 1.6 Standing rule: the suite reports its own evidence

**A suite says why it failed. Nobody diagnoses a failure from a symptom.**
When a run fails, the first fix is not to the product — it is to make the
failure name its own cause. Only then fix what it names.

What this means in practice:

- **A timeout is not a diagnosis.** `waitForURL` timing out says the page
  never arrived; it says nothing about why. A suite that can time out on a
  dependency (a sign-in, a service, a build) checks that dependency first,
  outside the browser, and fails there with what it found.
- **Print what the other side actually said.** Not "sign-in failed" but what
  `/auth/v1/settings` reports the server offers. Not "401" but the error type
  the verifier raised. A failure that carries the other side's own answer ends
  in one run.
- **Two plausible fixes in a row means the evidence is missing, not that the
  third guess will land.** Stop changing the product and make the suite talk.
- **CI logs are unreadable here** (`project-github-workflow`: job logs return
  403). The message thrown by the test is the whole of what we get, so it has
  to be enough on its own. Playwright's `github` reporter puts it in the
  annotations; make it worth reading.
- **This applies to the product too.** A path that fails closed in silence —
  a rejected token, a refused write — logs the error type and message, never
  the token, the claim or the data (Section 7.10).

**Why this is a standing rule and not one decision's footnote.** Twice in
Phase 5.5 a diagnosis lived somewhere unreadable and cost multiple round
trips: the `web-live` sign-in failure, where two convincing fixes were both
wrong and what ended it was a seeding-time check that printed the server's own
settings (D-166); and the session-token skew behind it, invisible until the
JWKS path logged why it had rejected a token (D-167). Both were found by
instrumentation, not by reasoning. A test that fails without saying why costs
more than the bug it is hiding.

**Related:** D-166, D-167; §1.4 on how a run is reported.

### 1.7 Standing rule: an isolation failure means stop and report

**When a check of an isolation boundary fails -- a sandbox, a tenant boundary,
a network or permission control -- stop and report it. Do not fix it and
re-run first.** (Founder, 2026-09-28, after the D-150 spike.)

The one exception is a bug in the *measurement*, not the boundary. A
measurement may be fixed and the check re-run **only if**:

1. the fixed check is shown to **fail against the positive control** -- run it
   where the boundary is absent (outside the sandbox, as the privileged user,
   in the other tenant) and quote it failing there. A check that cannot fail
   proves nothing when it passes; and
2. **both runs' output is kept** -- the failing run and the re-run -- next to
   the result, so a reader can judge the call.

If either cannot be done, the failure stands and is reported as a failure.

**Why:** in the D-150 spike, run 1's interfaces check failed because it read
`/sys/class/net`, which shows the machine's interfaces, not the sandbox's. The
fix was right, but it was re-run before the corrected check had been shown to
fail anywhere -- so for a while "PASS" rested on a check nobody had seen
fail. The positive-control run was done afterwards
(`docs/spikes/d150-fly-netns/evidence-run3-interfaces-control.txt`: FAIL on
the machine, PASS in the sandbox). The order is the rule: show it can fail,
then trust it passing.

**Related:** D-150; §1.6.

## 2. Inbound email (Postmark)

The inbound webhook answers two separate questions, and it is worth keeping them
separate in your head because only one of them is a secret:

- **Which tenant is this for?** The per-tenant token in the URL path. Public by
  design — it is the local part of the address the customer gives to its buyers.
- **Is this actually Postmark?** HTTP Basic credentials on the webhook URL. This
  is the secret, and it is the only thing standing between the intake endpoint
  and anyone who has ever received a PO from one of your customers (review
  finding H8).

### 2.1 Cutover order — credentials before enforcement

> **Do not run this on an address real customers send to until Stage 2c has
> landed** (founder, 2026-09-27; D-171). A refused request looks identical from
> outside whether it is a bad cutover or an attacker, and a bad cutover means no
> mail arrives at all. Until 2c raises a founder alert on refusal, the only
> signal is step 4's log line — which nobody is watching in real time. Staging
> and a test address are fine now; a production intake address waits.
>
> **2c builds that alert** (D-175): every refusal raises a high-severity
> `intake_webhook_refused` founder alert naming the reason, one open alert per
> reason. The condition is met for an address once migration `0029` is applied
> to the database behind it and the 2c code is deployed there. After a
> cutover, a refusal you did not expect shows up in the Console's attention
> panel -- `not_configured` or `no_credentials` means one of steps 1–3 went wrong;
> `mismatch` means the credential in Postmark's URL and the one deployed differ.


**Do these in order.** Step 3 is what makes mail flow; steps 1–2 are what makes
it flow *authenticated*. Doing 3 first means a window where the old hole is open;
doing 3 last means no window at all, at the cost of inbound mail being refused
until it is done — which is the right way round, and it is why a blank
credential refuses everything rather than falling back to token-only.

1. Generate the credential pair:

   ```
   python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
   ```

   Use a distinct value for the username too — it is compared in constant time
   like the password, so it is a second 32 bytes of secret, not a label.

2. Set `POSTMARK_WEBHOOK_USERNAME` and `POSTMARK_WEBHOOK_PASSWORD` in the API's
   environment and **deploy**. Inbound mail is now refused for everyone,
   including Postmark, which is expected: nothing is pointed here yet.

3. In Postmark, set the inbound webhook URL to carry them:

   ```
   https://USER:PASS@<api-host>/intake/email/{token}
   ```

   Postmark sends them as an `Authorization: Basic` header. Send one test mail
   and confirm a 200 in Postmark's own delivery log.

4. Confirm nothing is being refused. **From Stage 2c onward** this is the
   Console's attention panel: a refusal raises an `intake_webhook_refused` alert
   at severity **high**, once per day per reason, so a mistake in step 3 shows up
   in minutes rather than when a customer asks where their orders went.
   **Until 2c lands**, read the API log instead — every refusal logs
   `intake_webhook_refused reason=<word>`, and the word tells you which mistake
   it was:

   | reason | what it means |
   |---|---|
   | `not_configured` | step 2 didn't take effect — the environment has no credentials |
   | `no_credentials` | step 3 didn't take effect — Postmark is posting without them |
   | `mismatch` | step 2 and step 3 disagree — compare them, do not guess |
   | `not_basic` / `undecodable` | something other than Postmark is posting here |

**Never** put the credentials in the tenant's intake *address*, a Console
screen, a log line or a support thread. They are not in any of those today and a
test asserts it (`apps/api/tests/test_email_intake_auth.py`).

### 2.2 Rotating the credentials

Rotation has a gap by nature: Postmark's webhook URL holds one credential pair
at a time, so between changing the environment and changing Postmark, mail is
refused. Postmark retries a non-200 for a while, so a short gap loses nothing —
but keep it short and do it deliberately rather than discovering it.

1. Generate a new pair (2.1 step 1).
2. Update Postmark's webhook URL to the new pair **first**. Inbound mail is now
   refused; Postmark begins retrying.
3. Set the new values in the API's environment and deploy.
4. Send a test mail and confirm a 200 in Postmark's delivery log. Postmark's
   retries of anything refused in the gap now succeed.
5. Confirm no new `intake_webhook_refused` alert since the deploy.

**Rotate when:** the credential has been in a shell history, a screenshot, a
ticket or a third party's hands; someone with access to it leaves; or annually,
whichever comes first. Rotating is cheap and the gap is minutes.

**What rotation does not do:** it does not change any tenant's intake address.
Rotating a *tenant's* address is a separate, per-tenant action on the tenant page
(7.16.3) with its own grace period.

### 2.3 Confirming the source addresses, then enforcing the allowlist

`POSTMARK_INBOUND_IP_ALLOWLIST` is **log-only until confirmed** (D-155). An
allowlist enforced on a guess silently drops customers' purchase orders, which
is the exact failure the product exists to prevent — so it corroborates the
credentials, it does not replace them.

1. Leave it blank until real inbound mail is arriving.
2. After the first genuine inbound mail, collect the source addresses the API
   saw. With the allowlist blank nothing is logged about the source, so set it to
   a deliberately wrong value (e.g. `203.0.113.1`) for the collection window:
   every request then logs `source_not_on_allowlist`, and the request's source
   address is in the web server's own access log.
3. Compare what you collected against Postmark's published inbound IP list
   (Postmark documents these; take them from Postmark's own page, not from a
   search result).
4. If they agree, set the confirmed addresses. **They are still log-only** — the
   code has no enforcing branch, deliberately. Turning enforcement on is a code
   change with its own test and its own `DECISIONS.md` entry, made once the list
   has been stable across a few weeks of real mail.
5. If they disagree, stop and find out why before changing anything. A source
   address that is not Postmark's and still passed the credential check is worth
   understanding, not filtering.

## 3. Onboarding a new tenant — checklist

The Console walks you through the nine setup steps (Intake → Go live). This
list is the checks that sit around them. Phase 6 completes it.

- [ ] **Check the line count of the prospect's largest sample order.** Open
  the biggest purchase order in their intake files and count its line items
  (or look at the line number of the last item).
  - Up to about 1,000 lines: DocFlow reads it in one pass. Measured on
    2026-09-26 (D-161): 600 lines read exactly in 8 minutes, about $0.81.
  - Over about 1,000 lines: DocFlow can't read it yet. It fails as DOC-020
    ("enter this order by hand for now") after a paid read of up to about
    15 minutes and about $1.40. Tell the prospect before go-live that orders
    this long must be keyed by hand for now, and record it in your onboarding
    notes. Splitting long orders across several reads is deferred (D-158).
